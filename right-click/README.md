It would be fun to have a little library enabling right-click on any webpage.

I see there is an angular npm package that does this. But I feel like it could be a bit more agnostic.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/right-click-menu

There's also
https://www.npmjs.com/package/rightclick

But that's totally different.

I would like to just expose a `onRightClick` function on any html element. And you could pass it different values.

Is this just a context menu thing?
