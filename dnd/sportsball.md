### Clubhouse

Elite clubhouse. Special tea. That everyone was drinking.
It was quite strong, and Gorgeous Greg has fallen ill.
I need to bring a doctor, without alerting anyone of the issue, or that this clubhouse exists

Caverns under the city. Warm light coming from the inside.
Small rickety door to your right, unlocked, but with a danger sign.
To your left, a massive oaken door with iron bandings.

Alter of Tymora stands near the doors (god of trickery)

Dining hall

-   Lavish, busy, people are drinking
-   everyone is very touchy feely
-   in the back of the room, there is a tall atomoton

Tea room

-   Where they are currently brewing the tea
-   Jar of squirming tadpoles next to the cauldron, and you see dead ones floating inside

Treasure room

-   Secret door

### Meeting Vincillius

Vincillius will offer Tadpole tea.

-   vincillius has tried it for the first time tonight (clearly a little tipsy / high)
-   "a business partner" introduced him to the tea.
-   you brew it with these live tadpoles, and it released psychic energy, allowing you to form an incredible connection with anyone else who's drinking the tea
-   Where did they come from? Vincillius doesn't know. Some adventurer who dives deep underground in the caves that span these two cities. Some ground water source. He suspects they come from mind-flayers, but you know - dormant. Inactive ones. Nothing to be afraid of.
-   Reverend McKalastar is cashing spells on Greg to try to stabilize him
-   If Vinvillius discovers that someone is turning into a mind flayer, he'll try to capture them to make more tea
