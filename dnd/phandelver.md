==================================== Day 1 ====================================
===============================================================================

### Meeting

The characters meet along the trail
Dakota is trying (and failing) to find the goblin trail.

Andy/Adam volunteer help.
Find a way to go through the woods (druid = nature check, otherwise they roll perception to find a trail)

===== Optional Goblin Fight =====
If they don't make progress, or fuck around too long, two goblins will attack. If they survive the two goblins, they can trace their way back to their camp.

The goblins will have the wanted poster with them. If one is defeated the other will run home.

### Goblin Camp

If the goblins don't attack they will find a rocky outcropping with the remains of a camp there. Juding by the crude fastenings, it appears goblin in nature.

If they inspect the site they will locate some burn horse meat, and the wanted poster

### On the way to Cragmaw Caverns

Once they've located the trail, they will make their way to the Cragmaw hideout.
As they approach the players will see the group of 20 goblins marching towards them, and dive into the woods (hopefully). The river is to their left, and empty plains on the other side of the river.

### Sneaking through the woods

`Following the goblins trail, you come accross a large cave in a cliffside five miles from the high road. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right hand side of the stream`

Sneaking up through the woods, they'll see the goblins guarding the cave
If they make any noise (each roll stealth DC15) the guarding goblin will here them and be convinced to fire a random arrow.

Everyone rolls a luck check to avoid the arrow. The person with the lowest luck is struck in the but for 1d4 damage.

That person then needs to make a constitution saving roll to not scream out in pain.
If they succeed, the other goblins will go back to sleep, and the goblin with the bow will walk out to the woods to retrieve his arrow.
From there the players _should_ be able to kill it.

If they can all roll above 10 stealth, the other goblins don't wake back up
If anyone fails the stealth roll, the other one wakes up and calls out to the first goblin
A player can roll deception to imitate the goblin. 15+ succeeds. Then they can sneak up on the remaining sleeping goblins.

### Fighting the goblins at the gate

If they players don't screw it all up, there should be two sleeping goblins at the gate. They need to ace these goblins really quick, since there is no way of knowing how many goblins are inside, and if one may run away to alert the others.

The rusing river to their left will mask most of the noises, so they shouldn't worry about that. Just making sure no goblin escapes.

If they loot the area they'll find some short bows, about 10 arrows, and some cooked meat

### Entering the cave

Entering the cave, the walk alongside the river on the steep stone steps.
The wolves start snarling and barking as they approach, but it's unlikely to alert the goblins, as you already heard the wolves before you entered. But they are being more ferocious as the see the characters approaching (especially the Dwarf).

At this point, only Dakota and Adam can see. The dragonborn does not have darkvision. And so will need to light a torch, or hold on to the others as they walk through the cavern.

### The wolves cavern

`Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure on the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sound of rattling chains greet your ears where two wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf's chain leads into an iron rod driven into a stalagmite.`

Charming the wolves:

-   Animal handling check of D15
-   if they players decide to feed the wolves the animal handling check goes to D10

If not charmed, each turn the wolves roll DC15, DC10, DC5 to try to escape their chains

Climbing the poop chute:

-   In the back of the wolf cavern is little ditch filled with trash and wolf excrement. If a player inspects the area they will also see a shaft leading upwards. A perception check of D10 will let them hear voices at the top of the shaft, and notice it's about 30 feet high.
-   If they choose to climb the shaft they must succeed a 10DC athletics check.
-   Fall damage is 1D6 per 10 feet

`at the top of the shaft you see a wooden cover with a hole just large enough to squeeze though, there is a trap door on this hole, but it is not latched`

If all players make it up the the chute, they find themselves in room 8 with Klarg

### The crevasse accross the river

`the main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down it's west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west accross the other side of the stream`

### Approaching the bridge

Anyone with darkvision can roll a perception check (andy can check too for the lols)

-   in fact if andy rolls a nat 20, then he will meditate and perceive a faint creaking sound in the distance

`in the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor`

### Sneaking under the bridge

### Twin Pools Cave

`This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall fills the pools, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. A wide opening stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the watefall echos through the cave, making it difficult to hear.`

Three goblins guard this cave.

You can sneak around them, or engage them. But if you engage, one will attempt to run off and warn Klarg

### Klargs Cave

`Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes towards a narrow crevas with a small wooden structure. There is a large opening to the north (Twin Pools cave) with the sound of rushing water. In the middle of the room the coals of a large fire smolder`

### THE FLOOD

Athletics rolls to hop on the rock wall and avoid the flood DC15
Stength rolls to hang on to the wall DC10
Stength roll to hang on under water DC15

Constitution roll if you're hanging on underwater
Stealth roll if you're hanging on the wall

Anyone who fails will be washed out to the front of the cave and take 1d6 damage

==================================== Day 2 ====================================
===============================================================================

### Rockseeker Provisions

`We found the map of Wave Echo Cave *pause for effect*`
`Ahem... Wave Echo Cave!`
`Do ya not know what we're talking bout?!`
`Alright. So you see these big ruins out here. Remnants of what Phlandever used to be`
`Aye there was gold and silver and iron in these rocks, but something much more`

`You see the caverns here wind their way all the way back to the ocean, and there's a point`
`where they all intersect deep under the earth. That's what the Dwarves, Gnomes, and Human `
`wizards of old harnesses. Harvesting the natural energy of the earth and conecntrating it `
`as a tool.`

`And a masterful tool it was! Spells and armor and artifacts. Not in 500 years has the world`
`seen craftsmanship to match.`

What happened to it
`Orcs. Uruth Ukrypt. Near 500 years ago they laid waste to half the continent. And Phandlever`
`became quite the strategic spot. Orc and dark wizard alike fought to take the cave, to use `
`it's power for their conquest.`

`Rather than see it turned to evil, the old wizards used all manner of power to defend the cave.`
`Ultimately turning the whole structure into a living weapon.`

`Wave after wave of orc would enter the cave, and none would return.`
`We reckon at some point it wasn't worth the bodies, and the Orcs moved on to other conquests. `
`They collapsed the entrance and tore up the roads to see that no one else should succeed.`
`And time took care of the rest. It's a lot of mountain out there. Lot of places to look.`

`But THAT is what we do. 20 years we've been prospecting these mountains. Pickin at scraps of gold`
`they left behind. Till one day we found it. A cavern that connects to the cave.`

`But finding it was just the first part. An army couldn't breach that cave. We needed a map`
`A way past the traps. And the knowledge to restore the cave.`

`AND UP UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO WE HAD THAT MAP`

Why can't you just redraw the map
`Well it's not just a piece of paper with an X on it! It wasn't a way TO the cave, it was a`
`way THROUGH the cave. Spells and tricks to disarm the many dangers of the cave.`

`Look we've been compiling this information from around the world, but now we have a bigger problem`
`Some one else is gonna be in the caverns`
`Now if it's just profiteering, I could understand. But I got a feeling that this Spider character may`
`have something a bit nefarious in mind here.

### Stonehill Inn

-   Toblin Stonehill - Inkeeper

Captain of the guard comes in to shakedown the innkeeper and is shocked to learn that Grunter is alive
He tries to play it off as being concerned about his well being, but leaves in a hurry.

The characters can try to follow him to learn where he goes with this information. He will run to `Tresendar Manor`
and report to `GlassStaff`.

If one character trails him, they may make it all the way back to the Manor. If all the players trail him he will
definitely notice and call them out. This could end up with a fight against the Redbrands

### Phandalin Mining Exchange

-   Halia Thornton - Owner

`Here the miners bring their valuable finds to be weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any`
`local Lord or Authority the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to`
`mining territories around Phandalin.`

### Temple

-   Sister Garaele - Elf Cleric

### Tresendar Manor

`More a castle than a house, the Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets.`
`The ancient manor seems like it was long abandoned, with signs of recent efforts to fix it up`

The manor will be fairly empty and in disrepair. but the cellars under will be much more elaborate.

What the redbrands know

-   The leader of the Redbrands is GlassStaff (because he literally has a glass staff). Only the Spider knows his true name.
-   The Spider has hired GlassStaff to bring the town of Phandalin under control, and has sent additional men, arms, and bugbears to help
    in this endeavor.
-   The lower part of the dungeon has some hideous Eye monster.
-   The redbrands have a goblin working for them as a messenger

### Necromancer's Tower

### Agatha's Lair

Located a few miles outside of town. Past the ruins of Triboar, which has been all but overgrown with trees.

`The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss`
`drape the branches and the air is noticably colder than it was in the ruins. Rounding a bend in the trail you `
`see a screen made from warped brances woven into a dome like structure. A low doorway leads inside.`

`A home of sorts within the dome. Sparsely furnished with chests, shelves, tables, and a reclined couch. All of `
`Elven craft.`

Agatha Appears

`The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A cold pale light flickers in the air, rapidly`
`taking the form of a female elf. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features`
`now.
